    <h3>Exercise 2 from Eloquent JavaScript Chapter 6</h3>

    <p>Write a class called 'Group' (since 'Set' is already taken). Like Set, it has
        'add', 'delete', and 'has' methods. Its constructor creates an empty group,
        'add' adds a value to the group (but only if it isn't already a member),
        'delete' removes its argument from the group (if it was a member),
        and 'has' returns a Boolean value indicating whether its argument
        is a member of the group.
    </p>
    <p>Use the === operator, or something equivalent such as 'indexOf', to 
        determine whether two values are the same.
    </p>
    <p>Give the class a static 'from' method that takes an iterable object 
        as argument and creates a group that contains all the values produced by 
        iterating over it.</p>
    <p>See results in console.</p>
    <script>
        class Group {
    // creates an empty array
    constructor(){
        this.members = [];
    }

    // checks if value already exists, if not adds the value
    add(value){
        if(!this.has(value)){
            this.members.push(value);
        }
    }

    // deletes the value by creating a new array without the value using 'filter'
    delete(value){
        this.members = this.members.filter(v => v !== value);
    }

    // checks if a value is already present
    has(value){
        return this.members.includes(value);
    }

    // static function that takes an iterable object as argument
    // and creates a group that contains all the values produced
    // by iterating over it.
    static from(collection){
        let group = new Group;
        for(let value of collection){
            group.add(value);
        }
        return group;
    }
}

let group = Group.from([10, 20]);
    console.log(group.has(10));
    console.log(group.has(30));

    group.add(10);
    group.delete(10);
    console.log(group.has(10));
