    <h1>Week 1 notes</h1>

    <h3>General Notes</h3>
    <p>This week I spent a lot of time reviewing the PDF "Doing stuff with
        Web things". It was a good review but I need to practice a lot more
        so that I can easily understand the concepts taught in this class.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Notes on Video: Master Mobile UX</h3>
    <p>Even though doing mobile first may require to do a rewrite of the site, it
        provides a better experience to the user on many devices, and addresses 
        constraints on mobile size and bandwith. Start small and scale up. Focus on 
        content and functionality.
    </p>
    <p>Help the user use the application in the easiest way possible and with
        minimal cognitive load. Make sure key items are on easy to access
        places on the screen. For example, on mobile phones, the easiest access
        is on the bottom of the screen. Improve loading times so that users stay
        longer in the application. Reduce image usage, or if needed, use SVG, 
        webfonts. Also optimize CSS and JS files. GZIP files to eliminate 
        unnecessary data (not sure what GZIP means, maybe compress files?)
    </p>
    <p> Implement strategic new designs. Place most commonly used items at the 
        bottom. It creates perception of speed, improves engagement rates and 
        increase user satisfaction. When creating forms, ditch labels. Instead
        use placeholders and floating text. Get rid of unnecessary imputs. When
        forms are long, use pagination (divide the form into sections) and include 
        a progress indicator so the user knows how much is left of the form to complete.
        Also enable autocomplete; it is faster and prodeuces less errors. Enable 
        number keypad when entering phone numbers, card numbers. Place phone numbers
        inside anchor tags so the user can directly call the business without having
        to copy and paste the number.
    </p>
    <p>Avoid pop-ups and pop-overs. Seriously, don't do it! Instead make ads small and 
        simple. They can expand when the user taps on them, or use sliding windows.
        Make ads unobstrusive as possible.
    </p>
