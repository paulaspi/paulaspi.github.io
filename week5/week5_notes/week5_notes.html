    <h1>Chapter 10: Testing and Debugging</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>There are different types of errors:</p>
    <p><strong>System Error:</strong> a problem with the system or external devices.</p>
    <p><strong>Programmer Error:</strong> the program has incorrect syntax or faulty logic.</p>
    <p><strong>User Error:</strong> the user has entered data incorrectly which the program is unable to handle. 
    Programmer should anticipate user errors and prepare the program to handle them.</p>

    <h3>Exceptions:</h3>
    <p>An error that produces a return value that can then be used by the program to deal with the error.</p>

    <h3>Stack Trace:</h3>
    <p>A sequence of functions or methods calls that lead to the point where the error occurred. </p>

    <h3>Warnings:</h3>
    <p>Can occur if there's an error in the code but it isn't enough to make the program crash.</p>

    <h3>Strict Mode:</h3><p>It produces more exceptions and warnings. It allows to spot errors earlier in the development face.
        To write in strict mode write the following line at the top of the JS file: 'use strict'.
    </p>

    <h2>Debugging in the Browser</h2>
    <p>Find the point in the code where errors occur. Use breakpoints that halt the progress of the code and allow you to see
        the value of variables at that point in the program.
    </p>

    <p>There are several options for debugging:</p>
    <p><strong>Alerts:</strong>the 'alert()' method allows to stop the program to check variables' values. Use currently discouraged.</p>

    <p><strong>Using the console:</strong>the 'console' object provides several methods for logging information and debugging.</p>
    <p>console.log() => can be used to log the value of variables at different points in the program but it doesn't stop the 
        program from running.
    </p>
    <p>console.trace() => will log an interactive stack trace in the console. Shows the functions that were called in thelead up to an exception occurring.</p>

    <h2>Debugging Tools</h2>

    <p>The <strong>'debugger'</strong> keyword creates a breakpoint in the code that pauses its execution and lets you see where the 
    program is currently up to. You can see variable values by hovering over them with the mouse. It is important to remove the keywords
    before shipping code because they will make the code stop.</p>

    <h2>Error Objects</h2>
    <p>These objects can be created in the code using a constructor function.</p>
    <p>example: const error = new Error();</p>
    <p>Takes a parameter that's used as the error message.</p>

    <p>There are seven more error objects used for specific errors:</p>
    <p><strong>EvalError</strong> => currently not being used. It was used to identify errors when using the 'eval()' function.</p>

    <p><strong>RangeError</strong> => thrown when a number is outside allowable range of values.</p>

    <p><strong>ReferenceError</strong> => when a reference is made to an item that doesn't exist.</p>

    <p><strong>SyntaxError</strong> => there's an error in the code's syntax.</p>

    <p><strong>TypeError</strong> => error in the type of value used.</p>

    <p><strong>URIError</strong> => there's a problem encoding or decoding the URI</p>

    <p><strong>InternalError</strong> => non-standard error. Thrown when an error occurs in the JS engine.</p>

    <p>'error' objects have a number of properties:</p>
    <p><strong>name</strong> => returns the name of the error constructor function used as a string.</p>
    <p><strong>message</strong> => returns a description of the error. Should be provided as an argument to the 'Error' constructor function.</p>
    <p><strong>stack</strong> => returns a stack trace for that error. Not safe to use in production sites.</p>

    <h2>Throwing Exceptions</h2>
    <p>You can throw your own exceptions using the "throw" statement. Use "throw" with an "error" object.</p>

    <h2>Exception Handling</h2>
    <p>When an exception occurs, the program stops running. We can handle this situation by catching the error.</p>
    <p>If we think that a piece of code will result in an exception, we can wrap it in a 'try' block. the code will run as normal
        but if an error occurs, we can pass the error object to a 'catch' block where we can deal with the error appropriately.
    </p>
    <p>A 'finally' block can be added after a 'catch' block. It'll always be executed after the 'try' or 'catch' block, even
        if an exception doesn't occur.
    </p>

    <h2>Tests</h2>
    <p>Writing good tests helps strengthen the code and allows for errors to be caught early.</p>

    <h3>Test-driven Development (TDD)</h3>
    <p>It means to write tests before writing any actual code.</p>
    <p>Workflow:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Write tests (that initially fail)</li>
        <li>Write code to pass the tests</li>
        <li>Refactor the code</li>
        <li>Test refactored code</li>
        <li>Write more tests for new features</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Jest</h2>
    <p>It is a TDD framework created by Facebook. It provides helper methods for common test assertions.</p>
    <p>Function test() takes two parameters. First parameter is a string  that describes what we are testing. The second 
        parameter is an anonymous function that contains a function called 'expect()' => This takes the function we are testing
        as an argument. Returns an expectation object. The expectation object has methods called 'matchers'. Some examples
        of matcher methods are: 'toBe()' and 'toEqual()'
    </p>
